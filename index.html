            You will be building an app that allows the user to play tic-tac-toe.
        </p>

        <div>
            Requirements:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There should be one button for each square on the tic-tac-toe board, and pressing a button should play a move
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pressing a button on the tic-tac-toe board should make that button display either ‘X’ or ‘O’, depending on whose turn it is
                </li>
                <li>
                    There should be a label displaying whose turn it is
                </li>
                <li>
                    If someone has won (that is, there are either three O’s or three X’s in a row), the label should state who has won
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the game ends in a tie (that is, there are no empty squares and no one has won), the label should state that it is a tie
                </li>
                <li>
                    There should be a separate button that, when clicked, restarts the game
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Here is an example of how your app should work if you used the colors white, black, and red:
